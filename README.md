# Sqeaky Turntable - Audio Player Project
[^1]: This README was generated with the assistance of ChatGPT.


This project marks my exploration into the world of Rust, specifically through the lens of building a web application with Leptos. Having come from a background in React, I was intrigued by Leptos and its potential to blend the familiar structure of React with the unique features of Rust. This seemed like the perfect way to deepen my understanding of Rust while leveraging my existing knowledge.

## Project Overview

The core of this project is a simple yet functional audio player. While the concept might be straightforward, the journey of building it in Rust using Leptos has been both challenging and rewarding. I was particularly drawn to how Leptos allows for a React-like approach in building components, but with the power and performance of Rust behind it.

## Why Leptos?

Leptos caught my attention as it offered a similar component-based structure to React but was natively written for Rust. This gave me the opportunity to apply concepts I am already learning while pushing my understanding of Rust further. The experience has been fulfilling, and I am eager to continue exploring Leptos as I take on more projects.

## Future Plans

I'm pleased with the progress made so far on this audio player and am excited about its potential. Moving forward, I plan to further refine and enhance its functionality. Additionally, I intend to integrate this player into a larger project, **TheReformedCodex**. It will become the core of **TheReformedCodex-Radio** as I work on rebuilding and relaunching that site.



### Original Used In Prompt
This audio player project stems out of my journey to learn Rust. When I read about Leptos I knew I had to try it out, and since I have some experience with React. Having a common frame of reference for much of the structure of the app but still leaving room for how Rust itself works, seemed a perfect combination.  I wasn't disappointed, I really enjoyed working with Leptos and intend to use it more as I rewrite some of my personal legacy project for redeployment.  On that note, after working on this little audio player project, I am happy with the direction it is going and plan on refining it more and incorporating the player into TheReformedCodex as TheReformedCodex-Radio as I rebuild and relaunch that site.
